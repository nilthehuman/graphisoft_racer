TODO list:
* write unit tests for the Evolver!
* use smart pointers instead of naked pointers
* change alibi UI to wonderful sherry UI by Adam <3
* implement "PredeterminedDriver": genes range from 0 to 4, each gene encodes a decision for a tick
* the Evolver class itself can technically be made an IOrganism and evolved by another Evolver
* clean up silly nonsense drivers -> less clutter in the source code
* maybe the Race should store a vector of race times
* check for memory leaks and plug them
* store the Evolver's current organisms on the stack somehow?
* any kind of performance tuning, really
